## About The Project

API gateways can be used for both monolithic and microservices-based apps. API gateways perform several key functions:

* Authenticating the requesters making API calls
* Routing requests to appropriate backends
* Applying rate limits to prevent overloading of your systems
* Handling errors and exceptions
* Terminating SSL traffic
